# wifi_Security_App
Wi-Fi Security App  An Android app that helps users stay safe on public and private Wi-Fi networks. The app scans nearby Wi-Fi connections, classifies them by security level (WPA3, WPA2, WEP, Open), and alerts users in real time when sensitive applications (e.g., banking, email, social media) are used on insecure networks.
